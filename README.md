## Precourse

My biggest take-away from the precourse was how hard this is.  I used to think it was enough just to get my code to work, now I see there is much more to it.

Projects:
* [JavaScript reference repository](https://github.com/elewa-academy/javascript-template)

* Final Project: [Repo](https://github.com/elewa-student/precourse-final-project), [Live](https://elewa-student.github.io/precourse-final-project)
